# Wanbing (Valerie) Zhao

I am an undergraduate graduate. I received my Bachelor of Physics with Honours from Shandong University in June this year. I am now taking a gap year and planning to apply for a Ph.D. in the fall of 2023. 

I have been lucky to be advised by [Lanling Zhao](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/zhaolanling/en/index.htm) and later by Guofu Xu who is in [Dianmin Tong](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dianmin-Tong)'s group at Shandong University.

I've also visited [Guorui Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1vAbo0oAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)'s group at Shanhai Jiaotong University, and [Xiao Yuan](http://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaoyuan/index.htm)'s group at Peking University.  

My research interests lie in quantum foundation, interface between quantum physics and computer science. <!--My motivation is to xxx.-->

## About Me

- I was born in Jilin, China. In my spare time, I like to dance hip-hop, watch movies and travel. I have a twin [sister](https://wy-go.github.io) who majors in artificial intelligence, which overlaps with my research to some extent.
