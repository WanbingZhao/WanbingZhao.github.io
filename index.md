I am a second-year PhD student at Rice University. My research focuses on quantum information theory, with particular interest in its interplay with many-body physics and quantum error correction. I have also worked on topics such as error mitigation and first-principles simulations. I am passionate about understanding the mathematical structures underpinning quantum systems and advancing the field of quantum computation.

## Research Experience

- **08/2023–Present**: [Kaden Hazzard & Nai-Hui Chia & Kevin Slagle](https://news.rice.edu/news/2023/rice-helps-lead-national-quantum-computing-research-efforts), Rice University  
  - Investigating the power and potential of various quantum hardware platforms for quantum computation.

- **08/2021–08/2022**: [Xiao Yuan Group](http://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaoyuan/index.htm), Peking University  
  - Proposed a novel measurement error mitigation algorithm to suppress the measurement error by applying the generative machine learning model.

- **02/2021**: [Guorui Chen Group](https://2d.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai Jiaotong University  
  - Enhanced the efficiency of a two-dimensional material transfer station for experimental setups.
