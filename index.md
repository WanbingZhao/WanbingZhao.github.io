# Wanbing Zhao
---

I am a third-year PhD student in the [Applied Physics Program](https://appliedphysics.rice.edu/) at Rice University, advised by Prof. [Vir B. Bulchandani](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/vir-b-bulchandani). My research focuses on quantum information theory and its interplay with many-body physics. I am passionate about understanding the mathematical structures underpinning quantum systems and advancing the foundations of quantum computation.

## Research

### Nonlocal games  
*Rice University*

- *Scalable tests of quantum contextuality from stabilizer-testing nonlocal games*  
  [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16654)]  
  We study a class of binary-valued n-player (n ≥ 3) nonlocal games that generalize Mermin’s parity game for the GHZ state to arbitrary stabilizer codes. We establish a universal upper bound of 7/8 on the classical values of such games whenever they admit quantum advantage, coming from the Reed–Muller code RM(3,n). We show that the local stabilizer algebra can give rise to simple scalable families of nonlocal games with unbounded quantum–classical bias ratios as n grows.

### Quantum error mitigation  
*[Xiao Yuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eUDwq-wAAAAJ&hl=en) Group, Peking University*

- *Measurement error mitigation with generative machine learning models*
  We propose a novel measurement error mitigation algorithm to suppress the measurement error by applying a generative machine learning model.
