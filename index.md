I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Rice University. My research focuses on quantum information theory, with particular interest in quantum error correction and its interplay with many-body physics. I have also worked on topics such as error mitigation and first-principles simulations. I am passionate about understanding the mathematical structures underpinning quantum systems and advancing the field of quantum computation.
